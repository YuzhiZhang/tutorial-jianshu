## What is a Super App?
The platform-based business model is taking a stronger grip on the digital economies. In fact, seven out of ten of the world’s most valuable companies today are platforms. Most recently, this trend has accelerated even further as companies cross-industry have started to shift away from single-purpose to multipurpose apps, resulting in the rise of a brand new breed of product — the Super App.
In short, a super app is a marketplace of services and offerings, delivered via in-house technology and through 3rd party integrations.

Furthermore, the benefits of the super app approach extend to:
* Faster and less risky product launches: You already have an audience to market to, as well as a wealth of data that will help you shape the right offering and pitch it to the right people at the right time.
* Lower product ownership and development costs: Most of the ‘mini-apps’ on WeChat were not developed in-house, but created through integration by companies who wanted to conduct business with WeChat’s immense user base. Most ‘super apps’ follow the platform-based approach to scale their products.
* Minimized KYC costs and effective onboarding: Ant Financials managed to reduce their loan application and approval process to 3 minutes (while maintaining very low default rates). Most KYC data is automatically synced from the customer’s all-encompassing social and financial profile. Onboarding new users for new services becomes simpler as well.
## How to develop a Super App ? 
In my opinion, possible scenarios using mobile native technologies + Mini App + Hybrid technologies.
1. Host, This app works as a platform or a host for the services mentioned above. 
2. Mini App, independent small programs running difference services.
3. Hybrid technologies: Native for core App, Html/javascript for mini apps.Using Web technologies to create mini-apps gives more freedom and flexibility than native ones; one of Web applications characteristics is the possibility to update without installation.
